<p>It’s very constructive to understand the relationship between the
functions available in highcharter and the underlying highchartsJS API
in more detail. Understanding the relationship will allow you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Search for all the available chart customisation options implemented
as arguments in the various <code>highcharter</code> functions.</li>
<li>Reverse engineer R implementations of any <code>highcharts</code>
chart you see created in javascript instead of R.</li>
<li>Use the javascript <a href="https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/" class="external-link">API reference
documentation</a> directly to help you build your
<code>highcharts</code> charts in R.</li>
</ul>
<p>To explore this relationship, we’ll be looking at the Palmer penguins
dataset.</p>

<p>Let’s first assume that we have a base chart with some visualisation
of a dataset. To build a scatter plot of the Palmer penguins’ bill
length vs flipper length split by species we would use the following

<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="example">Example<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#example"></a>
</h2>
<p>Suppose we want to customise the chart legend on our
<code>highchart</code>. Let’s say we want to: place the legend inside
the plot area, arrange the legend entries in a vertical arrangement, and
add a title to the legend.</p>
<p>Let’s check the documentation of the <code><a href="../reference/hc_legend.html">hc_legend()</a></code> with
<code><a href="../reference/hc_legend.html">?hc_legend</a></code> function in R to see how we could go about
that.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="op">?</span><span class="va">hc_legend</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="help-hc-legend.png" width="100%"></p>
<p>Forgetting the examples for now, the R help suggests no specific
arguments for a <code>highcharts</code> legend <em>at all</em>. It’s not
immediately obvious what’s required or valid as an input to the
<code><a href="../reference/hc_legend.html">hc_legend()</a></code> function, let alone how we could add the exact
customisations that we want to our basic chart. What is provided is a
link to the legend section of the <code>highcharts</code> API
documentation which can be found <a href="http://api.highcharts.com/highcharts#legend" class="external-link">here</a> a screenshot
of which is below.</p>
<p><img src="hc-api-legend.png" width="100%"></p>
<p>The properties in the green box are an exhaustive list of the
arguments (there are more than those shown) available for a
<code>highcharts</code> legend. On the right each argument has a short
description, definition of valid argument values and sometimes a link to
an example (powered by JSFiddle) where you can see the argument being
used in a real chart.</p>
<p>Searching through the list of options the <code>layout</code>
property looks like the right option to control the item arrangement,
which we can confirm by clicking through to the JSFiddle <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/library/pure/highcharts/highcharts/tree/master/samples/highcharts/legend/layout-vertical/" class="external-link">example</a>.
JSFiddle provides a self-contained environment to see and tweak
javascript <code>highcharts</code> and it’s helpful to see exactly what
each argument does. Below we can see the <code>layout</code> does indeed
reorient the legend items and in this example we also see handily that
<code>verticalAlign</code> moves the legend up and down the chart area
and <code>align</code> performs the same operation horizontally.</p>
<p><img src="hc-api-legend-jsfiddle.png" width="100%"></p>
<p>So it seems that the right set of legend properties we need to adjust
in the legend are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>layout</code>, <code>align</code>, <code>verticalAlign</code>
as we see above.</li>
<li>
<code>floating</code> allows the legend to float within the plot
area.</li>
<li>
<code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are manual vertical adjustments in
pixels we can use to lift the legend to just inside the chart area.</li>
</ul>
<p>To adjust these properties in R (where the properties are single
strings or numbers) it’s a direct translation from javascript property
to R function argument like so:</p>

need to add the legend title. There are
some arguments in the API documentation that look like sets of nested
properties. Importantly for this exercise, the <code>title</code>
argument look exactly like one of these properties.</p>
<p><img src="hc-api-legend-title.png" width="100%"></p>
<p>The drop-down + curly braces (highlighted in green) on an argument
like this tell you that what <code>highcharts</code> expects here is a
self-contained set of properties that sit within the border property
set. In this case the title property takes two arguments
<code>text</code> and <code>style</code> which define the title text of
the legend and the legend title CSS style respectively.</p>
<p>To correctly create this hierarchical set of properties within the R
<code><a href="../reference/hc_legend.html">hc_legend()</a></code> function we need to use named lists. Each time
the API documentation defines an property to be it’s own self-contained
object within a broader set of properties you simply open a new list in
your R function call. This will mean that sometimes the values provided
to arguments within <code>highcharter</code> functions are nested lists
with 2 or even 3 levels. This can seem complicated, but having the API
documentation as a reference makes the process trivially easy.</p>
<p>Style is a special set of properties, not enumerated in the
documentation, that apply <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/" class="external-link">any CSS style</a> to a given
chart component. Putting this all together alongside the previous
adjustments: defining the legend header text and adding an underline to
the legend header (with a CSS property) looks like this:</p>

<p>The many functions built for the highcharter package are closely
coupled to options and classes available for the javascript library.
These options are very well documented in the extensive highchartsJS API
reference documentation. Loosely understanding this coupling: how
functions and their arguments map to build JSON objects that define
javascript Highcharts should supercharge your use of the R package.</p>
